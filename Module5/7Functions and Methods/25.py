# 25.	Practical Example: 7) Write a Python program to print the substring between index values 1 and 4.

# Define a string
a = 'Hello, world!'

# Access the substring between index 1 and 4 using slicing
# substring = a[1:5]  # Starts at index 1 and goes up to index 4 (5th character is not included)

# Print the substring
print('The substring is: ', a[1:5])
